# playdatePulpExamples
Examples of game components in playdate pulp.

These have been exported "unminnified" but are still pretty hard to read in json format.  I would recomend just importing to https://play.date/pulp.

## Chase Example 
Has the Snake Sprite move toward the player 3 times per second.
Uses an emit update in the game script to keep control the movement speed of the snake.

All Examples use the micro-roguelike tile set from here:
